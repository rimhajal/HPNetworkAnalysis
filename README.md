##### Data:

The network graph is drawn from the Harry Potter dataset found [here](https://github.com/efekarakus/potter-network/tree/master/data). The graph detecting the smaller communities within the network through the Louvain method is available at `.output.png`.\
It yielded poor results (modularity < 0.2), but coherent nevertheless.
