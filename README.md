# HPNetworkAnalysis

This repository is an application on what we learned from community detection within networks.\
Here, we are using a dataset that describes the relationship between Harry Potter characters. \
We then drew a graph that detects the smaller communities within the network using the Louvain method.\
It yielded poor results (modularity < 0.2), but coherent nevertheless.
