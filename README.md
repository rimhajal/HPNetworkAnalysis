# HPNetworkAnalysis

This repository is an application on what we learned from community detection within networks.
Here, we are using a dataset of the Harry Potter characters to draw a graph that detects the smaller communities within the network using the Louvain method.
It yielded poor results (modularity < 0.2), but coherent nevertheless.
